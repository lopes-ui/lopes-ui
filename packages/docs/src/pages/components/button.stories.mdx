import { Canvas, Meta, Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs";
import { Button } from "@lopes-ui/react";

<Meta title="MDX/Button" component={Button} />

export const Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

<Story name="button">{Template.bind({})}</Story>

We can drop it in a `Canvas` to get a code snippet:

We can even preview multiple Stories in a block. This
gets rendered as a group but defines individual stories
with unique URLs, which is great for review and testing.
